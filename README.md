 |paragraph | text | Shaun Murphy, a young autistic surgeon who has savant syndrome, relocates from 
 a quiet country life to join the surgical unit at the prestigious San Jose St.
 Bonaventure Hospital a move strongly supported by his mentor, Dr. Aaron Glassman.

 medical skill and intuition to save lives and challenge the skepticism of his colleagues.
